Quasi's Modular Station Buildings
=================================

Hello!

This is my station building set for OpenTTD. You can use these modular station buildings for your small to medium-sized towns. Or for your large towns — I won't judge.
All buildings in this set are objects, which means you'll find them in your objects menu, not your stations menu. This groups all four orientations conveniently together (instead of just two).

The buildings are designed to fit snugly together and play nicely with other station sets, so you can use whatever platforms you like.
Each building has a light concrete ground tile, making them a perfect match for sets like the wonderful City Objects.
You can choose between different building materials and door/window positions for that extra bit of variety.

Finally, a small disclaimer: I'm not an artist or a programmer, so please excuse any flaws in the sprites or the messy coding.

I hope you have fun building stations with this set! Thanks for checking it out.
